# Network SVC & App Development

This repo will contain code, assignments, and possibly notes for the network svc and app development independent study.

## Code formatting

Java code will be formatted using clang-format with llvm styling.

```bash
clang-format -style=llvm <filename_goes_here.java>
```

## Assignments
Assignments will consist of two different file types. The assignments will be created in LaTeX (.tex) and either Word/LibreOffice (.docx) or converted into a PDF from the LaTeX file. This will be determined at a later date.
