# Network SVC & App Development

This repo will contain code, assignments, and possibly notes for the network svc and app development independent study.

## Code formatting

C, C++, C#, and Java code will be formatted using clang-format with llvm styling.

```bash
clang-format -style=llvm <filename_goes_here.language_extension>
```

## Assignments
Assignments will consist of two different file types. The assignments will be created in LaTeX (.tex) and either Word/LibreOffice (.docx) or converted into a PDF from the LaTeX file. This will be determined at a later date.

## Resources
Within the code directory, there is a resources folder. This folder contains a text file for resources we used throughout the independent study. Please place the any useful and relevant resources in this text file.
